                I am a left box.  I am trying to think of something to say, but it just isn't coming out right.  The thing is...I love you man.  And I don't ever want to see you go.  But I know that sometimes these things just happen, and I don't want to stop you from being the man you were born to be.  Wow.  This really escalated quickly.  And now I am just typing more text to see if this is going to wrap around the way I want it to.  Otherwise, I'm not sure what i will do.  Well, crap.
